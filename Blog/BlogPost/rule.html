        <div class="content">
            <h3>Keep it simple.</h3>
            <p class="post">Clean is better than cluttered. Website visitors get frustrated when they can't find the
                content they
                need. Keep your
                pages simple, and your website will be easier to use.

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Make a good first impression.</h3>
            <p class="post">When you meet someone for the first time, it is important to make a good first
                impression. Cos first impression lasts. The same holds true for
                websites. Most users will judge the quality of your website within a few seconds visited.
            </p>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Provide intuitive navigation.</h3>
            <p class="post">Website navigation should feel natural and effortless. Pages and sections should be
                well-organized with a clear
                hierarchy so visitors can easily browse through the different areas of your site.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Be consistent.</h3>
            <p class="post">You can use different design templates within your website, but the pages should flow
                together with a cohesive style. A
                consistent look and feel across your site provides a natural experience.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Choose your colors carefully.</h3>
            <p class="post">Color selection can make or break a website. When choosing colors, use a limited palette
                of four or five colors that
                don't clash. If possible, provide a dark mode option for users who prefer a dark background.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Make your website responsive.</h3>
            <p class="post">People access websites from a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets,
                laptops, and desktop computers. Your
                website should look great on all these devices. CSS media queries make it possible to implement
                responsive web design
                with minimal code.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Develop for multiple browsers.</h3>
            <p class="post">People don't just use different devices â€” they also use different web browsers. Test
                your website in multiple browsers
                to make sure everything functions correctly. Try to fix problem related to most browsers.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Check your website for errors.</h3>
            <p class="post">A small mistake can tarnish a great piece of work. Check your website regularly for
                typos, broken links, and images that
                do not load correctly. Validate your HTML and CSS to make sure there are no syntax errors.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Write your own code.</h3>
            <p class="post">The best webmasters write their code from scratch. If you build a site from a WordPress
                template, your design options
                will be limited. When you code your own pages, you have full control over how they look and act.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Don't forget the content.</h3>
            <p class="post">
                A beautiful website without content is nothing more than an empty shell. A great website requires
                thoughtful design and
                engaging content. Make sure your pages include original, high-quality content that makes them worth
                visiting.
